## the author

"Immigration" is a poem written by Meeko Israel, a longstanding resident of Oberlin, OH, the eponymous town surrounding Oberlin College. While I was a student at the college, my bookbinding class partnered with Meeko to create artist books from his poetry.

shove it in your face
creative

using her money
	her body
to become a
citizen
	sitting on

imagining

live in a nation
	where she is truly free

the new york city streets
are paved with gold
at least that's what she was told
who?
who
who are they?
	they are the folks who
	went before her
who she knew actually made it
	on an airline ticket
no more slave steps
	her friend wrote her in a letter
[TODO LOL]
the u.s.
the u.s.a.

actually fed her
until she found one of the
three jobs she now has
[TODO AGAIN]
because		because they say
	because
most yankees don't even want one
they just
	they just like to
sit on their ass and have fun
