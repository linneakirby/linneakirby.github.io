## what is "the egg book"?

The egg book provides a helpful guide to the identification of various eggs and what species they belong to. Complete with an index and fully rendered images, the egg book is a must-have for oologists everywhere.

I spontaneously created "the egg book" one day in the year 2000 and I doubt I will ever live up to this level of creativity and academic rigor again.

As stated on the back cover, "this is the only book of this".

Can you tell I traced the chicken egg?
