Vibroraptile is a vibrotactile display that maps auditory signals from a nature exhibit to give visitors the ability to not only see and hear, but also feel otherwise untouchable animals. Touch is a crucial modality when designing a tool that is inclusive for all populations, including those with disabilities or impairments; furthermore, young visitors who cannot read and visitors who do not speak the language used in the exhibit are unable to gain insight from written information and so can benefit from the addition of haptics. We believe Vibroraptile would be a useful addition to natural history museums, zoos, aquariums, national parks, and animal sanctuaries. For our submission, we simulated a regional exhibit (northeastern North America) by showcasing a day in the life of a blue jay family. With the addition of curated haptics effects, visitors are able to "touch" the animals they hear in our audio soundscape, such as blue jays, mourning doves, chipmunks, woodpeckers, coyotes, and a hawk.
