Touch is a crucial modality when designing a tool that is inclusive for all populations, including those with disabilities or impairments; furthermore, young visitors who cannot read and visitors who do not speak the language used in the exhibit are unable to gain insight from written information and so can benefit from the addition of haptics. We believe Vibroraptile would be a useful addition to natural history museums, zoos, aquariums, national parks, and animal sanctuaries. For our submission, we simulated a regional exhibit (northeastern North America) by showcasing a day in the life of a blue jay family. With the addition of curated haptics effects, visitors are able to \u0026ldquo;touch\u0026rdquo; the animals they hear in our audio soundscape, such as blue jays, mourning doves, chipmunks, woodpeckers, coyotes, and a hawk.\nSubmitted to the IEEE World Haptics Conference 2021 Student Innovation Challenge.\nvideo ","date":"31 December 1969","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/vibroraptile/","section":"projects","summary":"","title":"vibroraptile","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"31 December 1969","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/whc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Whc","type":"tags"},{"content":" a trove of unique scents clamshell box with invented binding the book Previous Nextsads handmade clamshell box with labeled perfume sample bottles containing colorful, odorless water paired with a description of the labeled \u0026ldquo;scent\u0026rdquo;\nthe story behind anosmia perfumery I can\u0026rsquo;t smell.
