<p>Linnéa Kirby is a self-proclaimed "Contemporary Renaissance Person," with interests ranging from the creative to the analytical. Linnéa received a B.A. in Psychology with a concentration in Cognitive Sciences and a minor in Computer Science from Oberlin College in 2016. She graduated from a year of the New England Center for Circus Arts (NECCA)’s PROTrack program in 2018, where she majored in contortion and unofficially minored in Chinese Pole. She is now pursuing a Master's in electrical engineering at McGill University's where she is a member of the <a href="https://srl.mcgill.ca/">Shared Reality Lab (SRL)</a>, the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/cim/">Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.cirmmt.org/en">Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music, Media, and Technology (CIRMMT)</a>.</p>

Throughout her work, Linnéa has explored a range of topics, often imbued with dry wit, including perception of self and of the world, interaction between objects and space, and the bounds of femininity and androgyny.
